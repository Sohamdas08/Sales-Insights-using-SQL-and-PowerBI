# Sales-Insights-using-SQL-and-PowerBI


Project Overview

Sales Insights using SQL and Power BI is an end-to-end business intelligence project developed to analyze and visualize the sales performance of Nataraj Electronics for January 2025.
The objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from raw transactional data using SQL and transform them into a visually interactive Power BI dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.

Data Model Overview

The project is built on a relational data model with four key tables:

Table Name	Description
public_customers	Contains customer demographic details such as name, address, and city.
public_products	Holds product-related information including name, category, description, and MRP.
public_sales	Transaction table capturing sales quantity, selling price, sale date, and payment mode.
Date	Custom date dimension table containing Year, Month, Quarter, and Day attributes.
Relationships

public_sales[customer_id] ‚Üí public_customers[customer_id]

public_sales[product_id] ‚Üí public_products[product_id]

public_sales[sale_date] ‚Üí Date[Date]

This star schema model enables efficient filtering, aggregation, and trend analysis.

Tools & Technologies Used
Tool / Technology	Purpose
SQL	Data cleaning, transformation, and creation of analytical queries.
